    "- 2 Using the variable navigator provided by GSS, determine the years applicable and narrow your dataset accordingly.\n",
    "- 3 Visualize at least two quantiative relationships or patterns: these might include connections between clear numerical values, such as age and income, or more complex visualizations based on boolean data (for example, our \"yes\" and \"no\" to reading fiction.)\n",
    "- 4 Group the data using at least two different divisions to spot interesting trends, and plot at least one variance across a group (refer to our example of happiness among fiction readers as a starting point.)\n",

    "## Methodology for Determining Search Codes \n",
    "\n",
    "I am interested in the intersection of military service, firearm ownership, and support for legalization of marijuana.  Through various searches in the GSS Codebook, I found the following applicable codes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- MILWRKEV - EVER WORK FOR MILITARY OR DOD?\n",
    "- MILWRKNW - CURRENTLY WORK FOR MILITARY OR DOD?\n",
    "- VETAID - ANY IN HH RECEIVE MIL OR VET BENEFITS\n",
    "- MEMVET - MEMBERSHIP IN VETERAN GROUP\n",
    "- GUNLAW - FAVOR OR OPPOSE GUN PERMITS\n",
    "- OWNGUN - HAVE GUN IN HOME\n",
    "- GUNSDRNK - SHOULD CARRYING A FIREARM DRINKING ALCOHOL BE ILLEGAL\n",
    "- GRASS - SHOULD MARIJUANA BE MADE LEGAL\n",
    "- GRASSY - SHOULD MARIJUANA BE LEGAL-VERSION\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I could not find a simple yes or no code for military service.  The closest codes I found were MILWRKNW and MEMVET.  Both have their draw backs.  MILWRKNW could refer to both military personnel and civilians working for the military.  MEMVET would specifically deal with veterans, as vet groups require military service, but this is a smaller subset than just being a veteran.  I’ve decided to use MILWRKNW as a stand in for ‘yes or no military service.’ as this code may most widely capture the kind of individual I am interested in. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will use OWNGUN for firearm ownership, as this is a relatively straightforward code.  If someone owns a gun, one would assume they support gun ownership.  I will use GRASS for approval of marijuana legalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will also include some basic demographic codes in my searches to further parse the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Years of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to focus on four years: 1975, 1991, 2007, 2018.  Except for 2018, these years signify important years in American military history.  1975 marked the end of the Vietnam War.  The Persian Gulf War occurred in 1991.  2007 marks a point of high intensity for the Global War on Terror, specifically with the troop surge in Iraq.  2018 is the last year of available data.  I will use this year to assess current opinions."
